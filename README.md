# KIPR Wallaby Program Backup Utility
Created by: Zachary Sasser

**Description:**
This is a list of programs that can help you backup your programs on your Wallaby, so that you will not lose your program in the event of a Wallaby malfunction or even just messing up your code. All of these options saves all projects on the Wallaby to an external storage for safe keeping.

This package comes with 3 tools for backing up your programs:
1. A program that runs on the Wallaby and moves all your projects from the **Wallaby to a USB Flash Drive**.
2. A program for Windows that moves all your projects from the **Wallaby to your PC**
3. A program for MacOSX and Linux that moves your projects from the **Wallaby to your Mac/Linux Machine**

**Wallaby 2 USB (easiest):**
1. Copy the contents of "Wallaby2USB-Backup-Tool.c" to a project on your Wallaby.
2. Plug in ONE flash drive and leave the other USB port empty.
3. Run the Program __from the Wallaby__
4. Wait for the program to say "DONE!" and now the USB flash drive contains all your programs.

**Wallaby 2 Windows:**
1. Download the program "Wallaby2Windows-Backup-Tool.bat" and place it in your desktop.
2. If it is in a .zip file, right click and click "Extract Here"
3. Double click the "Wallaby2Windows-Backup-Tool.bat". If nothing happens, right click and click "Run as Administrator"

**Wallaby 2 Unix for MacOS/Linux (hardest):**
1. Download "Wallaby2Unix-Backup-Tool.sh" and place it in your downloads folder (or wherever you want)
2. If it is in a .zip file, double click on the file to unzip it.
3. Open Terminal
4. Go to the folder you saved Wallaby2Unix-Backup-Tool.sh in by typing the following: "cd ~/Downloads"
5. Type "ls" and check to make sure "Wallaby2Unix-Backup-Tool.sh" is listed.
6. type "sh Wallaby2Unix-Backup-Tool.sh". If that fails try "sudo sh Wallaby2Unix-Backup-Tool.sh" and enter your password.

**Recommended Instructions:**
1. Create a github account or log in if you have one.
2. Find the button to "create a new repository" (might be a book icon and/or a plus sign)
3. Give the repository a name like "Zachary's Botball Programs" or "GCER 2020"
4. Put down a description of what kind of programs will be stored in your repository like "Botball 2020 code"
5. If your code is top secret, select "Private". Otherwise, leave it as "Public"
6. Check the box that says "Initialize this repository with a README" or it is going to be more difficult for you.
7. Once your repository is made, click "upload files" and then drag and drop all of the code you transfered from the Wallaby.
Now your programs are saved!

**Clarification:**

-README is basically a description of what the project is. What you are reading right now is a README.txt file!

-Github has much more than just being a storage unit for programs! It can do things like keep track of all your past changes so you can revert to an older copy of your code, or keep track of your notes so you know what you changed each time you update your code.
